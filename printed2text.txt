difference in stroke orientation and stroke length between
handwriting and printed text. Compared with text, noise
blocks often have simple stroke complexity. Therefore,

CTOSs

 

ing count histogram features are exploited to model
such differences. We further take regions of machine printed
text, handwriting, and noise blocks as different textures, Two
sets of bilevel texture features (bilevel co-occurrence features
and bilevel 2 7 2 gram features) are used for classification. In
the following sections, we present these features in detail.
